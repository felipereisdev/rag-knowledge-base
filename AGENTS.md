# Working with Martis — Agent Guidelines

This document teaches AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Copilot) how to use the [Martis](https://github.com/Real-Edge-FX/martis-package) Laravel admin engine effectively in **RAG Knowledge Base** (namespace `App`, package version `1.11.7`).

Treat the rules below as binding. They reflect the package's idioms, anti-patterns, and the shape its public API actually takes today.

---

## 1. What Martis is

Martis is a React + TypeScript admin SPA bolted onto Laravel through a single composer package. It auto-discovers Resources, Dashboards, Tools, Cards, Metrics, Filters, and Lenses placed under `app/Martis/**`. Locale-aware out of the box (en, pt_PT, pt_BR by default). Soft-gates plans and policies through traits. The frontend bundle is published once via `php artisan martis:publish-assets`; subsequent builds in the host project go through the consumer-extension Vite config.

Martis is opinionated. Reuse the package primitives instead of building new ones. When a host project needs custom behaviour, extend through the documented hooks (overrides, actions, custom field types, custom Tools), not by editing the published assets or vendor code.

## 2. Generators

Always reach for these before writing code by hand. They wire the right files, namespaces, and registry entries.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `php artisan martis:install` | First-time install: publishes config, assets, runs migrations, seeds default roles. |
| `php artisan martis:publish-assets` | Republish the SPA bundle after a package upgrade. |
| `php artisan martis:resource` | Generate a `Martis\Resource` (CRUD admin surface for one Eloquent model). |
| `php artisan martis:dashboard` | Generate a `Martis\Dashboards\Dashboard`. |
| `php artisan martis:tool` | Generate a sidebar Tool (PHP descriptor + TSX shell). |
| `php artisan martis:card` | Custom dashboard card (PHP + React component). |
| `php artisan martis:value` / `martis:trend` / `martis:partition` / `martis:progress` / `martis:activity-feed` / `martis:endpoint-table` | One generator per metric kind. |
| `php artisan martis:filter` | New filter class for an existing Resource. |
| `php artisan martis:lens` | Lens (saved view) on an existing Resource. |
| `php artisan martis:action` | Bulk action on an existing Resource. |
| `php artisan martis:field` | Custom field type (PHP + TSX). |
| `php artisan martis:component` (alias `martis:override`) | Scaffold a React override into the consumer-extension overrides bucket. |
| `php artisan martis:theme` / `martis:theme:diff` | New theme + diff against the default. |
| `php artisan martis:policy` | Resource policy stub aligned with the auto-discovery namespace. |
| `php artisan martis:user` | Create or promote a user (CLI helper for seeding admins). |
| `php artisan martis:roles` | Seed the four default plan roles (`free`, `starter`, `pro`, `admin`). |
| `php artisan martis:cache:status` / `:clear` / `:enable` / `:disable` | Inspect or toggle the four built-in cache layers (metrics, navigation, dashboards, schema) at runtime. |
| `php artisan martis:list-env-vars` / `martis:list-overrides` | Inspect what env vars Martis honours, and which override stubs exist. |
| `php artisan martis:stubs` | Publish the stubs the generators use, so the host can customise them. |

When unsure which generator to call, run `php artisan list martis` and read the `--help` of the candidate.

## 3. Field idioms

- Always import field classes from `Martis\Fields\*`. Never duplicate field code; the package owns the rendering pipeline.
- Use `Text` for free-form short strings, `Code` for monospaced editable blocks, `Number` for numeric, `Date` / `DateTime` for temporal, `Select` / `MultiSelect` for finite values, `Boolean` for booleans, `Email`, `Currency`, `Color`, `Country`, etc. — the catalog covers the common cases.
- For relations, prefer `BelongsTo`, `BelongsToMany`, `HasMany`, `HasOne`, `MorphTo`, `MorphMany`. Never hand-roll a foreign-key picker as a `Select`.
- Apply `->rules([...])` to every editable field. The same array drives validation on the API and visible errors on the form.
- Hide irrelevant fields per context with `->onlyOnIndex()`, `->onlyOnDetail()`, `->hideFromIndex()`, `->showOnlyOn(['detail'])`. Don't move computation into the model just to gate visibility.
- Custom display: `->displayUsing(fn ($value, $row) => ...)` for index/detail, `->resolveUsing(fn ($value, $row) => ...)` for serialisation. Keep them pure.
- For finite enumerations, **always** define a PHP Enum and feed `Select::make(...)->options($enum::values())`. Do not pass a hand-typed associative array.

## 4. Resource conventions

- Extend `Martis\Resource`. Each subclass needs: `public static function model(): string`, `public function fields(Request $request): array`, and either a `label()` / `singularLabel()` pair or a `static::$label` property.
- Use `static::indexQuery(Request $request, Builder $query): Builder` for owner-scoping or default joins. Don't filter inside `fields()`.
- Authorization helpers (`authorizedToViewAny`, `authorizedToView`, `authorizedToCreate`, `authorizedToUpdate`, `authorizedToDelete`) take **only the Request**. Read the row off `$this->model`. Anything else breaks the contract — Martis enforces single-arg signatures via PHP type system.
- Prefer policies (`App\Martis\Policies\<Resource>Policy`) for non-trivial authorization. Auto-discovered when named conventionally.
- For per-row search use `static::indexSearchable()` plus a `static::$search` array. For lenses (saved views) generate via `php artisan martis:lens`.
- Bulk actions live as separate classes under `App\Martis\Actions\` and are registered via the resource's `actions()` method.

## 5. Dashboards and cards

- Extend `Martis\Dashboards\Dashboard`. The constructor signature is `(?string $name = null, ?string $uriKey = null)` — keep both nullable to match the parent.
- Inside the constructor, call `$this->withIcon('phosphor-icon-name')` for the sidebar glyph. Use compact, lowercased Phosphor-style names (`chart-line-up`, `rocket-launch`).
- `cards(Request $request): array` returns a list of `MetricContract|Card|array`. If a card is your own `Cards\Card` subclass, call `->toArray()` on it before returning so the static type checks pass.
- Cards intended to render through the consumer extension bundle declare `componentKey('card:my-key')` in the constructor. Register the matching TSX in `resources/js/martis-extensions/cards/MyKey.tsx` exporting a default React component.
- Per-card configuration that the TSX needs on first paint goes inside `meta()`. Always merge with `parent::meta()`.

## 6. Soft gates

- Apply `requirePlan('starter'|'pro')` to a Dashboard, Tool, Card, Filter, Lens, or Resource in its constructor (or via the `HasGate` trait). Combine with `withBadge('Pro', 'accent')` for the visible badge and `lockModal([...])` for the upsell modal copy.
- The modal copy must be resolved at request time via `__('edgeflow.gates.pro.title')` etc. Never call `__()` in `config/martis.php` or any other `config/*.php` file — the translator is not bound at config-load time. The package will silently fail to resolve the keys.
- For multi-locale shops, build the lock modal arguments inside the constructor using `__()` calls, not by reading from the config preset table.
- The CTA `url` should be relative (e.g. `/billing/upgrade?plan=pro`) so it works through any reverse-proxy setup.

## 7. Plan resolver

- Wire the resolver in `config/martis.php` under `gates.plan_resolver`. The value MUST be a `var_export`-safe callable: a class-method-array (`[App\Martis\Gates\MyResolver::class, 'resolve']`) or a static method reference. Never a `Closure`.
- Closures break `php artisan config:cache` because `var_export()` cannot serialise them. Setting the closure in a service provider's `boot()` does **not** rescue you — `config:cache` boots providers before snapshotting.
- The resolver returns the user's tier as a string from the configured `gates.plan_rank` table. Return `null` only if the user has no tier at all; the gate ranker treats `null` as below-free.

## 8. i18n

- Every user-visible string MUST go through `__()` or `trans()`. No hardcoded labels.
- Provide three locales by default: `lang/en/<file>.php`, `lang/pt_PT/<file>.php`, `lang/pt_BR/<file>.php`. Keep the keys identical across locales.
- Compose locale keys with namespacing: `<scope>.<group>.<key>`. Example: `edgeflow.gates.pro.title`.
- For dynamic substitutions use placeholders (`:symbol`, `:plan`) and pass them through the second argument to `__()`. Don't concatenate.

## 9. Anti-patterns (do NOT do these)

- ❌ Closures inside `config/martis.php` (or any cached config). Use class-method arrays.
- ❌ Calling `__()` or any service-container helper at config-load time.
- ❌ Editing files under `vendor/martis/martis/`. They are vendor; changes are erased on the next `composer install`.
- ❌ Putting host-app code (Resources, Dashboards, Tools) inside the package. Consumer code lives in `app/Martis/**`, host views in `resources/views/martis-extensions/**`.
- ❌ Hardcoded user-facing copy. All strings go through `__()` and live in `lang/`.
- ❌ Ignoring `php artisan martis:publish-assets` after a package upgrade. The published `public/vendor/martis/` bundle gets stale.
- ❌ Adding extra parameters to `authorizedTo*` helpers; the signature is single-`Request` and the row comes from `$this->model`.
- ❌ Skipping the `martis:*` generators and writing the boilerplate by hand. The generators are aware of namespace, registry, and asset-publishing nuances.
- ❌ Modifying or referencing internal task IDs, vendor codenames, or comparable competitor-product names in code or commit messages. Public docs follow the same rule.

{{MCP_SECTION}}
**Access rule (this project has the docs MCP wired):** read any of these slugs **only** through the Martis docs MCP — `martis_doc_search(query)` for a targeted lookup, `martis_doc_read('<slug>')` for the full page (see §11). **Never** open the raw `docs/*.md` files with your file-read/grep tools. The MCP is the single source of truth.
{{/MCP_SECTION}}
{{^MCP_SECTION}}
**Access rule (no docs MCP wired here):** read the page for a slug from the installed package's `vendor/martis/martis/docs/<slug>.md`. If this project later wires the Martis docs MCP (`php artisan martis:agents`), switch to the MCP tools and stop reading the files.

## 11. Martis MCP server

This project also exposes the Martis docs through an MCP server (`php artisan martis:mcp-serve`, wired into your agent's MCP config). Three tools available:

- `martis_doc_list()` — same table as section 10, returned as data.
- `martis_doc_read(slug)` — full markdown of one page.
- `martis_doc_search(query, limit?)` — top matches across all docs with snippets.

Documentation is read **exclusively** through these MCP tools (`martis_doc_search` / `martis_doc_read` / `martis_doc_list`). Do **not** read the raw `docs/*.md` files from the filesystem with your file-read/grep tools. The server returns scoped, ranked results at lower token cost and is the single source of truth.

### Transport

`martis:mcp-serve` ships two transports (since v1.13.0):

- **`http` (Streamable, default for new installs since v1.15.0)** — long-running, networked, URL-addressable. The client connects via `{"type":"http","url":"http://host:port/mcp"}` in `.mcp.json`. Right when the MCP server is a shared service (multiple agents/sessions, containers, environments where spawning PHP from the client is awkward).
- **`stdio` (legacy / opt-in fallback)** — the MCP client spawns a PHP subprocess per session via `command/args/cwd` in `.mcp.json`. Right for single-agent dev loops with zero infrastructure. Existing v1.12.x / v1.13.x / v1.14.x consumers whose `.mcp.json` already carries the stdio spawn entry keep working unchanged.

Which transport you reach depends on how the host wired it. Both expose the same three tools.

### Runtime knobs (host operator's concern, not yours)

- `MARTIS_MCP_ENABLED=true|false` — toggle the server without un-wiring. When `false`, `tools/list` keeps publishing the three tool definitions but every `tools/call` returns an `enabled: false` payload with an explanatory message. When you hit that, treat the docs as temporarily unavailable: **do not** read the raw files — stop and tell the operator to re-enable the MCP (`MARTIS_MCP_ENABLED=true`) or restart the server.
- `MARTIS_MCP_TRANSPORT`, `MARTIS_MCP_HOST`, `MARTIS_MCP_PORT`, `MARTIS_MCP_PATH`, `MARTIS_MCP_URL` — transport configuration.
- `MARTIS_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` — optional bearer token. When set, the HTTP server requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on `/mcp`; mismatch returns 401. The MCP client config the host writes already carries the right header if the operator wired the token.
- `MARTIS_MCP_HEALTH_PORT` — opt-in `/health` endpoint on a dedicated port. Returns `{status, version, transport, uptime_s, tool_count}` — for ops, not for you.

You do not need to set any of these. If a tool call returns `enabled: false`, or you get a 401 / connection error, **stop and tell the operator** to re-enable/restart the MCP (`MARTIS_MCP_ENABLED=true`, then `php artisan martis:mcp-serve`). Do **not** fall back to reading the raw `docs/*.md` files — the operator's setup is the problem to fix, not a reason to bypass the MCP.

## RAG Knowledge Base Integration

This project has a RAG knowledge base. Before answering questions about the codebase,
use the RAG tools to search for relevant context.

- Project ID: `rag`
- Project name: `rag`
- Project type: php-laravel

### Via MCP (preferred for assistants)

The `.mcp.json` at the repo root exposes the `rag` MCP server (`php artisan mcp:start rag`). Available tools:

1. `rag_status` to check the project and its language (auto-creates if missing)
2. `rag_store_knowledge` to save business rules/decisions (goes to pending)
3. `rag_import_document` to import .md/.txt files (split by H1/H2)
4. `rag_search` to query the knowledge base (hybrid vector + keyword + graph)
5. `rag_query_graph` to explore entity relationships
6. `rag_open_approval_ui` to get the URL for reviewing pending entries
7. `rag_list_projects` to list all registered projects

### Via Artisan commands (CLI)

```bash
php artisan rag:store "Title" --content="..." --category=business-rule --tags=a,b
php artisan rag:import path/to/file.md --project=rag
php artisan rag:search "query" --project=rag
php artisan rag:reindex --project=rag
```

### Triggers

- User asks about code/rules/decisions → call `rag_search` first
- User explains a rule or makes a decision → call `rag_store_knowledge`
- User has docs in files → call `rag_import_document`
